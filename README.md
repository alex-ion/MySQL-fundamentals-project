# MySQL-fundamentals-project

This project was created for the final exam for "MySQL fundamentals" course I had made at BitAcad.
In spite of having just to write some basic SQL queries for LDD and LMD, I've chosen to add some PHP code with the knowledge I had at the beginning of the year. The project requests received from the teacher are beautifuly arranged on the page between the SQL and PHP code itself.
Indeed, some of the SQL instructions are not to be embeded into PHP script (such as triggers), but at that time I didn't know that.
